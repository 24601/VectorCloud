# VectorCloud
Here is a list of features I want to include in this project, if you have
anything to add to list let me know and I will put it on here. I will be constantly adding things as I learn more about the SDK.

Disclaimer - I am a busy person and will be working on this in my free time. Please feel free to
contribute.

## Soon

* develop RESTFUL API
* document code
* create how to install/run section in readme
* create a login function to prevent unauthorized access
* add network state, pose, status output to status
* add more buttons to home screen for more robot functions
* animations list page with links with ability to click to animate vector (all thousands of them) with search option.
* create a text box to type in text to display on vector's face


## Eventually
* set up uWSGI
* set jsonify and make pages load more dynamically
* create 'waiting on vector' animated .gif for load times
